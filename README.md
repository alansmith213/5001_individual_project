# 5001_individual_project

This is a simple prediction program written by python. Using Min-Max,
method and other methods to do the data normalization and preprocessing work. Manually selected 8 features from the dataset to do 
the prediction job, Keras sequential model was implemented and used for training the model,
predict the outcome value from test dataset. On the Kaggle public board, the prediction values got 1.3 score, but it was
having some overfitting problem when training the model. On the private board, the submission file only got 6.1 score.
